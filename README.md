<h1 align="center">Sonarium</h1>

<p align="center"><em>An MCP server that turns an AI agent into a sound engineer.</em></p>

Sonarium is an **orchestrator, not a generator**: it provides instruments
(band-limited oscillators, FM, supersaw, noise, a polyphonic sequencer),
effects (filters, EQ, drive, mod fx, dynamics, delay, reverb), and mixing /
mastering tools — and an agent composes with them through MCP tool calls.
There are no canned presets; the agent does the sound design, the server does
the DSP.

The agent authors a **symbolic synthesis graph** (oscillators → envelopes →
filters → modulation → mix). Sonarium renders it **deterministically** — the
same graph and seed always produce identical audio — and feeds back analysis:
levels, loudness, spectral centroid, transient descriptors, plus a
**spectrogram and a waveform image**. The agent iterates by inspection, like a
sound designer at a DAW, then exports game-ready WAV / FLAC / OGG.

Pure Rust, local, offline. No GPU, no API keys.

## Quick start

```bash
make daemon     # release build + install & start the background service (launchd / systemd)
# or foreground: make
```

Then point a client at it:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http sonarium http://127.0.0.1:8787/mcp
```

`make help` lists every target. Common ones: `make serve` (foreground HTTP),
`make stdio`, `make test`, `make check` (fmt + clippy + tests — the pre-commit
gate). Override host / output dir: `make serve BIND=127.0.0.1:9000
WORKDIR=./game/assets/audio`.

### stdio (client spawns the binary)

```bash
claude mcp add sonarium -e SONARIUM_WORKDIR=/path/to/game/assets/sfx -- /path/to/sonarium
```

Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sonarium": {
      "command": "/path/to/sonarium",
      "env": { "SONARIUM_WORKDIR": "/path/to/game/assets/sfx" }
    }
  }
}
```

Renders and exports land in `SONARIUM_WORKDIR` (default `~/.sonarium/sounds`)
— point it at your game's assets folder to drop sounds straight in.

## What it does

- **Author & surgically edit.** `author_sound` renders a graph;
  `describe_sound` → `set_param` / `edit_sound` change one parameter or node by
  path (`root.inputs[0].freq`) without re-sending the graph; `undo_sound` /
  `redo_sound` step a 20-deep per-sound history. Sounds **persist across
  restarts** under stable slug ids (`laser_zap`) usable directly as engine
  asset keys.
- **Hear with eyes.** Every render returns numeric analysis (peak, true peak,
  RMS, crest, ≈LUFS, spectral centroid, attack/decay/onset/silence times) plus
  a **spectrogram and a waveform image**. `compare_sounds` gives metric deltas
  + a similarity score to converge on a reference.
- **Reproducible sessions.** Every mutating tool call is journaled to
  `session.jsonl`. `save_session` snapshots it; `replay_session` re-applies a
  saved journal into a fresh working directory (enforced) — same calls, same
  seeds, **byte-identical audio**. A session file is a portable, diffable
  project file ([example](examples/laser_session.jsonl), replayed in CI).
- **Variations, not presets.** `mutate_sound` nudges parameters;
  `generate_variants` makes N level-matched round-robin takes; `humanize`
  applies one coherent pitch + level shift per take; `morph_sounds`
  interpolates two same-shaped designs (charge tiers, damage levels).
- **Ship-ready output.** Top-level `normalize { target_lufs, ceiling_dbtp }`
  loudness-matches through a soft-knee true-peak limiter. `playback: loop`
  renders **seamless loops** (equal-power crossfade; WAV carries a `smpl` loop
  chunk). Export WAV / FLAC / OGG Vorbis.
- **Packs, not files.** Banks with categories + round-robin groups;
  `export_bank` / `export_all` write every member plus a `sounds.json`
  manifest, and optionally **engine files**: Godot `.import` sidecars, Unity
  `.meta` (stable GUIDs), or a generated Bevy `sonarium_sounds.rs`.

### Resources

- `sonarium://schema/sounddoc` — the `SoundDoc` JSON Schema.
- `sonarium://cookbook` — example graphs and authoring tips
  (single-sourced from [`docs/cookbook.md`](docs/cookbook.md)).

## The synthesis-graph DSL

A sound is one `SoundDoc`:

```json
{ "name": "laser_zap", "duration": 0.22, "sample_rate": 44100, "seed": 0, "root": { ... } }
```

`root` is a single node; every node evaluates to a mono signal. Add optional
top-level `stereo` (wide / Haas) for BGM and ambience, `playback` for seamless
loops, and `normalize` for loudness-matched output.

**Sources** — `square{freq,duty}` (duty modulatable ⇒ PWM), `triangle`,
`sawtooth`, `sine`, `noise{color: white|pink|brown}`, `fm{freq,ratio,index}`,
`super{wave,freq,voices,detune_cents}`, and `seq{bpm,steps_per_beat,wave,duty,
env,notes}` for melodies, basslines, and drum patterns — pitches read musically
(`"C4"`, `"F#3"`, `"midi:60"`).
**Envelope** — `env{a,d,s,r,punch}`.
**Combinators** — `mix` (sum), `mul` (source × envelope), `chain` (source →
processors).
**Processors** — `lowpass`/`highpass`/`bandpass`/`notch{cutoff,q}`,
`peak{cutoff,q,gain_db}`, `lowshelf`/`highshelf{cutoff,gain_db}`, `gain`,
`drive{amount,shape}`, `ringmod`, `chorus`, `flanger`, `phaser`, `compress`,
`bitcrush`, `downsample`, `delay`, `reverb`.
**Modulators** (any numeric param) — `slide`, `lfo`, `arp`, and
`env{a,d,s,r,from,to}` (an ADSR mapped onto a range ⇒ filter / pitch
envelopes).

### Example — laser zap

```json
{
  "name": "laser_zap",
  "duration": 0.22,
  "root": {
    "type": "mix",
    "inputs": [
      { "type": "mul", "inputs": [
        { "type": "square", "duty": 0.25,
          "freq": { "slide": { "from": 880, "to": 180, "secs": 0.18, "curve": "exp" } } },
        { "type": "env", "a": 0.0, "d": 0.18, "s": 0.0, "r": 0.02, "punch": 0.3 }
      ]},
      { "type": "mul", "inputs": [
        { "type": "noise" },
        { "type": "env", "a": 0.0, "d": 0.04, "s": 0.0, "r": 0.0 }
      ]}
    ]
  }
}
```

The [cookbook](docs/cookbook.md) has many more — sequenced melodies, FM bells,
filter envelopes, layered impacts, looping ambience beds. Every JSON example in
it is parsed and validated by the test suite.

### Showcase — a real piece of music

[`examples/river_flows_in_you.jsonl`](examples/river_flows_in_you.jsonl) is a
session file that renders the intro + main theme of Yiruma's *River Flows in
You*: a MIDI transcription converted into two polyphonic `seq` layers (melody
+ accompaniment, 104 notes) with reverb, stereo width, and a −14 LUFS master —
authored entirely through `author_sound` and replayable with one
`replay_session` call. [`examples/midi_to_seq.py`](examples/midi_to_seq.py) is
the small converter that turns any MIDI file into `seq` notes, so you can feed
Sonarium real scores.

## Build

```bash
make release        # → target/release/sonarium   (or: cargo build --release)
make test           # the full unit + integration suite
make check          # fmt + clippy -D warnings + test  (pre-commit gate)
```

Rust 1.88+ (edition 2024). OGG encoding builds vendored libvorbis, so a C
toolchain is required. CI runs the same fmt + clippy + test gate on pushes to
`main` and on pull requests.

## Production notes

- **Stay on loopback.** The HTTP server is meant for same-machine clients;
  don't expose it to a network.
- **Deterministic by contract.** A sound is fully determined by its graph +
  seed; the graph JSON is written next to each WAV, so renders are
  re-creatable and version-controllable. The PRNG is pinned to reference
  vectors by tests.
- Logs go to stderr (`RUST_LOG=debug` for more); the stdio JSON-RPC stream
  stays clean.
